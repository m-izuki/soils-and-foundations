Soils and Foundations - Research Summaries

This repositry contain summaries of reaserch papers published in the journal "Soils and Foundations".
Each summary is presented as a slide single, highliting the key findings and contributions of the paper.

The aim of this project is to provide quick and easy to understand summaries of reaserch papers from "Soils and Foundations".
By condensing each paper into a single slide, I hope to make the reaserch more accessible to students, reaserchers, and professionals in the field of geotechnical engineering or others.

Uploaded as pdf, with the number at the end of the DOI of each paper in the file name.
